//Rectangle into Squares

//The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle 
//into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

//Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

//You will be given two dimensions
    //a positive integer length
    //a positive integer width

//You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; 
//Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the 
//size of each of the squares.
